    This formula installs the latest version of the helios-solo tools,
    but it doesn't upgrade the Helios image. If you have upgraded from
    an older version of helios-solo, switch to the latest image by
    running:

        helios-use latest

    You can run `helios-use` to switch to any available Helios version
    whenever you'd like, even without upgrading helios-solo.
